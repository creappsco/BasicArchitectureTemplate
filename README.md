# Basic Architecture Project Template

This is a project template that allows the creation of a basic architecture for medium-sized projects.

We implement the most used design patterns in .NET: Repository Pattern and UnitOfWork; We remove the business logic from the controllers and implement Services to perform it.

We create sample unit tests for your future implementations.
